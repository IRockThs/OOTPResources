# OOTPResources
A list of public resources for the OOTP Community, but primarily focused around Perfect Team and Theme Teams (TTC).

This repository is meant as a place where individuals can upload their resources in a way that is permanent but can also be updated. If you would like to add a resource to this list, please reach out to me at IRockThs#5658 on discord or twitch.tv/irockths.
