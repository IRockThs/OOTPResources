PT Card List with Card Sets - Contains the PT Card list with columns showing if the card is packable, a mission reward, or a tournament reward. Includes Plat Series and Limited Editions as well. Primarily designed to allow TTC members to determine how easy a card will be to obtain. Updated through 1/2/23.

Tournament Era Cheat Sheet - A cheat sheet that allows users to quickly compare run environments to the modern era. Useful for building era tournament rosters.


Iron Model Publish December 7 - Initial model created after the live updates. Contains all cards through plat 4.

Bronze Live - A Bronze Live Double Elimination Tournament model. Not nearly as solid as the Iron model, in part due to Bronze Live not being able to model defense effectively. I added a position adjustment to the final WAR number (not vL/vR) to account for their position differences, but this should be used more as a guide than a bible.

Iron Model - Most up to date Iron model unless otherwise noted. Version history in the file tells you what the latest change(s) are.


Live Perfect Draft Model - model trained on data from after the BABIP change, modeling the June Live Update cards.
