Data Exports: Contains the exports for various models if anyone wants access to the raw data.

Tournament Era Cheat Sheet - A cheat sheet that allows users to quickly compare run environments to the modern era. Useful for building era tournament rosters.

Iron Model - The most recent iron model. This one is built from Iron Quick data from the first two weeks of the game. Updated with the cards released on April 1.


PT 24 Folder:
Iron Model Publish December 7 - Initial model created after the live updates. Contains all cards through plat 4.

Bronze Live - A Bronze Live Double Elimination Tournament model. Not nearly as solid as the Iron model, in part due to Bronze Live not being able to model defense effectively. I added a position adjustment to the final WAR number (not vL/vR) to account for their position differences, but this should be used more as a guide than a bible.

Iron Model - Most up to date Iron model unless otherwise noted. Version history in the file tells you what the latest change(s) are.


Live Perfect Draft Model - model trained on data from after the BABIP change, modeling the June Live Update cards.

Live Perfect Draft Latter May - Data used to build the Live Perfect Draft Model
