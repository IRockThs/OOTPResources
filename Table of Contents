Data Exports: Contains the exports for various models if anyone wants access to the raw data.

Tournament Era Cheat Sheet - A cheat sheet that allows users to quickly compare run environments to the modern era. Useful for building era tournament rosters. NOTE: the pitcher requirements are possibly out of date. AngeredUnicorn has noted issues with stamina in 26 that mean you might need more pitchers in all modern formats (13 or 14), and I have seen some recommendations to carry more than 3 starters earlier than the 1960s. I need to learn more about these changes before I update this file.

Iron Model - The most recent iron model. There is some inconsistencies noted in the file. I would say that this is about 80% accurate, but a very good start to 26.

PT25: I only made an iron model for PT25 before I quit, so it's a smaller archive.

PT 24 Folder:
Iron Model Publish December 7 - Initial model created after the live updates. Contains all cards through plat 4.

Bronze Live - A Bronze Live Double Elimination Tournament model. Not nearly as solid as the Iron model, in part due to Bronze Live not being able to model defense effectively. I added a position adjustment to the final WAR number (not vL/vR) to account for their position differences, but this should be used more as a guide than a bible.

Iron Model - Most up to date Iron model unless otherwise noted. Version history in the file tells you what the latest change(s) are.


Live Perfect Draft Model - model trained on data from after the BABIP change, modeling the June Live Update cards.

Live Perfect Draft Latter May - Data used to build the Live Perfect Draft Model

Iron Late May Export - raw exports from Daily Late Iron tournaments using YourKidnies' export formats.

Iron Late May Model - raw exports from Daily Late Iron tournaments in the second half of June using YourKidnies' export formats.
